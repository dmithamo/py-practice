Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your 
credit card number, phone number or answer to 
your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone 
could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. 
Instead, we mask it.

Your task is to write a function maskify,

A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks 
that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into 
a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. 
Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a 
way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just 
have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
