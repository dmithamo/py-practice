A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks 
that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into 
a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. 
Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a 
way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just 
have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
